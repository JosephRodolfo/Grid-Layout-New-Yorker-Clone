# Grid-Layout-New-Yorker-Clone

This was a project to learn more about CSS Grid. The layout design is mostly a copy of the New Yorker (https://www.newyorker.com/). I added a much more extensive two column layout than the original, however, and created my own implementation of the nav bar that shrinks/expands on scroll.

Technologies used: Javascript, HTML, CSS
